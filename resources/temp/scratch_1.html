  The Olympiad is organized by The Association of Global
  Universities, in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and
  Higher Education of the Russian Federation and the Federal
  Agency for the Commonwealth of Independent States Affairs,
  Compatriots Living Abroad, and International Humanitarian
  Cooperation (Rossotrudichestvo). <br />
  The competition is aimed at talented foreign students who would
  like to enroll in master's and postgraduate programs in Russia
  for free.

  The winners of the Open Doors are granted a free early admission
  at any Russian university, without entrance examinations and
  with tuition fees covered by the Russian Federation.

  The competition winners will be able to enroll in a program
  using a single-window system, choosing any of Russian
  universities. The language of instruction is English or Russian
  depending on the chosen program and the university.

  The Olympiad has two tracks - for prospective Master's and
  doctoral students (analogous to Ph.D.). The Olympiad is held in
  two rounds for the Master's track and in three rounds for the
  doctoral track (analogous to Ph.D.). The first round is a
  competition of portfolios, and the second round is a
  problem-solving challenge. The third round of the Olympiad
  involves the selection of a prospective research supervisor for
  the chosen doctoral program (analogous to Ph.D.) and an
  interview with him/her.

  The competition is open to foreign citizens and stateless
  persons, including compatriots living abroad, having a
  Bachelor's degree or completing a Bachelor degree program in the
  year of the Olympiad for the Master's track and having a
